# Automation Log

This file tracks daily automated progress on the graphene thesis repo, so
each run can pick up where the last one left off without repeating work.

## 2026-08-21

**Status:** First automation run (no prior log existed).

**Repo state at start:** README + `graphene_band_structure.py`,
`graphene_transport_properties.py`, `optical_absorption`-related plots and
scripts covering intrinsic material properties only (band structure,
DOS, quantum Hall effect, universal optical absorption). No device-level
content (contacts, gate capacitance, transistor I-V, RF metrics) existed yet.

**Work done:**

1. **Research notes** (`notes/2026-08-21-contact-resistance-and-quantum-capacitance.md`):
   Literature review of metal-graphene contact resistance (physical origin,
   representative values from recent papers: Pd ~110 Ohm.um at 6K, Ni ~470
   Ohm.um from a 2024 fabrication-process study) and graphene quantum
   capacitance (functional form, role in vertical-scaling limits, and why
   it requires self-consistent I-V modeling). Full citations included.
   Web search (WebSearch tool) was available and used for this research.

2. **Code + results** (`graphene_fet_model.py`,
   `quantum_capacitance.png`, `gfet_transfer_characteristics.png`):
   New device-physics module implementing a thermally-broadened quantum
   capacitance model, a self-consistent channel carrier density combining
   C_ox and C_q, and a long-channel Id-Vg transfer characteristic model for
   a 200 nm GFET including a literature-calibrated series contact
   resistance term. Verified to run standalone and produce physically
   sensible output (V-shaped ambipolar transfer curve, correct suppression
   of on-current with increasing contact resistance).

**Not yet covered (candidates for future runs):**
- RF small-signal model / f_T, f_max figures of merit
- Graphene interconnect resistivity vs. linewidth (finite-size/edge
  scattering effects)
- Photodetector responsivity
- Metal contact work-function-dependent doping profile (currently only a
  lumped series resistance, not a spatially resolved p-n junction model)
- thesis_draft/ section expansion (no thesis_draft/ content written yet --
  next run could draft an introduction or a "device applications" literature
  review section using the notes gathered so far)
- Explicit contact-resistance-vs-channel-length crossover plot (planned in
  notes section 4, not yet implemented)

**Commits this run:** 2 (notes commit, code+results commit).

## 2026-08-22

**Status:** Second automation run.

**Repo state at start:** README + intrinsic-property scripts, plus
2026-08-21's device-physics addition (contact resistance / quantum
capacitance notes, `graphene_fet_model.py` with quantum-capacitance-
limited GFET transfer characteristics). No RF figures of merit and no
`thesis_draft/` content existed yet.

**Work done:**

1. **Research notes**
   (`notes/2026-08-22-rf-figures-of-merit-fT-fmax.md`): Literature review
   of graphene FET RF cutoff frequency (f_T) and maximum oscillation
   frequency (f_max) — representative values (intrinsic f_T up to
   ~300-427 GHz in record devices, f_max ~200 GHz for a 60 nm T-gate
   device, extrinsic f_T/f_max ~34/37 GHz for foundry-style 0.5-2 um
   gates), the physical reason f_max lags f_T by roughly an order of
   magnitude for graphene (lack of current saturation), and how contact
   resistance (from the 2026-08-21 notes) and quantum capacitance
   directly set the small-signal model parameters. Full citations
   included. WebSearch was available and used for this research.

2. **Code + results** (`rf_small_signal_model.py`,
   `rf_figures_of_merit.png`): New module implementing a hybrid-pi
   small-signal RF model on top of the existing GFET DC model — g_m and
   g_ds via numerical differentiation of `transfer_characteristic()`,
   C_gs reusing the existing quantum-capacitance-limited gate
   capacitance, C_gd as a fraction of C_gs, and a distributed gate-
   resistance estimate. Computes and plots f_T(V_g) and a simplified
   f_max(V_g), plus a second panel showing extrinsic f_T degradation
   across the literature contact-resistance range (0-500 Ω·µm). Verified
   to run standalone; peak f_T ~20 GHz for the 200 nm long-channel device
   is consistent with the literature range for non-exotic gate lengths.
   Added an explicit code-level caveat (printed at runtime) for the
   bias points where the simplified f_max estimate comes out above f_T,
   since that contradicts the literature trend — traced to this compact
   model's idealized (low) parasitic gate resistance rather than hidden.

3. **Writing** (`thesis_draft/01-introduction.md`): First
   `thesis_draft/` content (folder did not exist before today). Drafted
   Chapter 1 introduction motivating the material-physics vs. device-
   applications split, summarizing the three device-physics effects
   covered so far (contact resistance, quantum capacitance, absence of
   current saturation and its RF consequences), and a chapter-by-chapter
   status table kept in sync with the codebase.

**Not yet covered (candidates for future runs):**
- Contact-resistance-vs-channel-length crossover plot (still planned
  from 2026-08-21 notes, not yet implemented)
- Graphene interconnect resistivity vs. linewidth (finite-size/edge
  scattering effects) — Chapter 5 material
- Photodetector responsivity — Chapter 6 material
- Metal contact work-function-dependent doping profile (still only a
  lumped series resistance, not a spatially resolved p-n junction model)
- A more careful f_max model with realistic pad/interconnect parasitics,
  to resolve the f_max > f_T artifact flagged in today's code caveat
- Further thesis_draft/ chapters (2-3 could be drafted from the existing
  band-structure/transport code and results; 4 partially supported by
  today's RF work)

**Commits this run:** 3 (RF research notes, RF small-signal model code +
plot, thesis_draft/ Chapter 1 introduction).
