# Automation Log

This file tracks daily automated progress on the graphene thesis repo, so
each run can pick up where the last one left off without repeating work.

## 2026-08-21

**Status:** First automation run (no prior log existed).

**Repo state at start:** README + `graphene_band_structure.py`,
`graphene_transport_properties.py`, `optical_absorption`-related plots and
scripts covering intrinsic material properties only (band structure,
DOS, quantum Hall effect, universal optical absorption). No device-level
content (contacts, gate capacitance, transistor I-V, RF metrics) existed yet.

**Work done:**

1. **Research notes** (`notes/2026-08-21-contact-resistance-and-quantum-capacitance.md`):
   Literature review of metal-graphene contact resistance (physical origin,
   representative values from recent papers: Pd ~110 Ohm.um at 6K, Ni ~470
   Ohm.um from a 2024 fabrication-process study) and graphene quantum
   capacitance (functional form, role in vertical-scaling limits, and why
   it requires self-consistent I-V modeling). Full citations included.
   Web search (WebSearch tool) was available and used for this research.

2. **Code + results** (`graphene_fet_model.py`,
   `quantum_capacitance.png`, `gfet_transfer_characteristics.png`):
   New device-physics module implementing a thermally-broadened quantum
   capacitance model, a self-consistent channel carrier density combining
   C_ox and C_q, and a long-channel Id-Vg transfer characteristic model for
   a 200 nm GFET including a literature-calibrated series contact
   resistance term. Verified to run standalone and produce physically
   sensible output (V-shaped ambipolar transfer curve, correct suppression
   of on-current with increasing contact resistance).

**Not yet covered (candidates for future runs):**
- RF small-signal model / f_T, f_max figures of merit
- Graphene interconnect resistivity vs. linewidth (finite-size/edge
  scattering effects)
- Photodetector responsivity
- Metal contact work-function-dependent doping profile (currently only a
  lumped series resistance, not a spatially resolved p-n junction model)
- thesis_draft/ section expansion (no thesis_draft/ content written yet --
  next run could draft an introduction or a "device applications" literature
  review section using the notes gathered so far)
- Explicit contact-resistance-vs-channel-length crossover plot (planned in
  notes section 4, not yet implemented)

**Commits this run:** 2 (notes commit, code+results commit).
